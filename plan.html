          <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, 
              the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, 
              and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>

          <h2>Top Things To Know</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Pack your patience: millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. 
                  Yosemite Valley is the main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park.</li>
              <li>Early birds avoid traffic! From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours 
                  (before 9 am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.</li>
              <li>Plan ahead: Due to current health guidelines, reservations are required to drive into 
                  Yosemite until October 31, as well as for lodging, camping, and backpacking.</li>
              <li>Keep wildlife wild: do not approach or feed animals.</li>
              <li>Drive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.</li>
              <li>Protect Yosemite’s bears: always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.</li>
              <li>Staying connected: cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in the park.</li>
              <li>How can you help four million people? Learn how to visit Yosemite in a way that is fun, memorable, and safe.</li>
